<!-- About -->
## About me.
Helloo everyone. My name is Usmon and I’m a Self-thought Android developer* looking for new challenges. As you can see, I haven’t really done many projects but I’m trying to do them. It’s going to be more fun if someone wants to collaborate with me. Now I’m learning something about Android, Kotlin, and more. Please reach me out if you want to.

<sup>* I don't have any commercial experience. I'm just an entry-level dev :(</sup>
